# Artanis Website Project Using PHP

Project Overview : During the industrial training period, I was given a project by Sara to make a new design for three pages of Artanis Cloud which is Ezran.my page, login for DezEzran.my page and DezEzran.my page. 
The two website pages which are Ezran.my and DezEzran.my, should use the same design that have been in that page including the description of the page, the number button on the page and the detail of the page such as info box. 
But for the login page, I need to make a new design for it since the page does not exist yet. 
After I have completed this project, I need to send my source code to the company so that they can easily publish this website. This project starts from 21 September 2022 until 29 September 2022.

Technologies used : Laragon Localhost, phpMyAdmin, Visual Studio Code, GitHub

Key Features and Achievements

Consistent Design Implementation: Both the Ezran.my and DezEzran.my pages were developed with consistent design elements, creating a cohesive user experience. 
This involved replicating styles, components, and page details accurately across both sites.

Login Page Development: Designed and developed a new login page for DezEzran.my, emphasizing accessibility and ease of use. The page included a responsive design that adapted well to different screen sizes.

Improved PHP Skills: Through this project, I significantly enhanced my knowledge and proficiency in PHP, especially in integrating front-end and back-end functionality to create dynamic web pages.

Database Management: Gained hands-on experience with phpMyAdmin, learning how to manage databases, perform queries, and integrate data with PHP for dynamic content rendering.
This project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to develop technical skills and apply them to create functional and aesthetically pleasing web pages for a real-world application.
