# Artanis Website Project Using PHP

Project Overview: During my internship, I have developed a PHP website for my company which consits 3 pages which is Ezran.my page, login for DezEzran.my page and DezEzran.my page. 
The two website pages which are Ezran.my and DezEzran.my, should use the same design that have been in that page including the description of the page, the number button on the page and the detail of the page such as info box. 
But for the login page, I need to make a new design for it since the page does not exist yet
