# Artanis Website Project Using PHP

During my internship, I developed a PHP-based website for my company, consisting of three key pages: Ezran.my, DezEzran.my, and a Login Page for DezEzran.my. 
The main objective was to maintain a cohesive design for both the Ezran.my and DezEzran.my pages, ensuring they shared the same visual and functional elements, including page descriptions, navigational buttons, and detailed information boxes.
While the Ezran.my and DezEzran.my pages required consistency in their design and layout, the Login Page was a new addition.
I was tasked with creating a completely fresh design for the login interface, as it did not previously exist. The new login page needed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and consistent with the overall theme of the existing pages.

Technologies used : Laragon Localhost, phpMyAdmin, Visual Studio Code, GitHub

Key Features and Achievements
Consistent Design Implementation: Both the Ezran.my and DezEzran.my pages were developed with consistent design elements, creating a cohesive user experience. 
This involved replicating styles, components, and page details accurately across both sites.

Login Page Development: Designed and developed a new login page for DezEzran.my, emphasizing accessibility and ease of use. The page included a responsive design that adapted well to different screen sizes.

Improved PHP Skills: Through this project, I significantly enhanced my knowledge and proficiency in PHP, especially in integrating front-end and back-end functionality to create dynamic web pages.

Database Management: Gained hands-on experience with phpMyAdmin, learning how to manage databases, perform queries, and integrate data with PHP for dynamic content rendering.
This project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to develop technical skills and apply them to create functional and aesthetically pleasing web pages for a real-world application.
